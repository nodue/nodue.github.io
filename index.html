    <!-- <p> I am a 17 year old computer science student from Canada.
      <br>
      <br>
      This is my website where you will get to see the progress I make while studying HTML and CSS. (and later on, possibly JavaScript)
      <br><br>
      If it suddenly stops receiving updates, that means that I have become busy or quit. Who knows, maybe nobody will ever see this.
      <br><br>
      Regardless, I will at least be updating this a little bit beyond this point. So stay tuned. Hopefully I will also include some descriptions in the git commits so I can keep track of what I have added and when.
