    <p> I am a 17 year old computer science student from Canada.
      <br>
      <br>
      This is my website where you will get to see the progress I make while studying HTML and CSS.
      <br>If it suddenly stops receiving updates, that means that I have become busy or quit. Who knows, maybe nobody will ever see this.
      <br>
      <br> Regardless, I will at least be updating this a little bit beyond this point. So stay tuned.
