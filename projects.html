      <li>Food Truck Project</li>
      <p>This was a very fun project that I made in my computer science class. I was tasked with making a food truck
        <br> "for my school". It was more of a mock-up than anything. However, I felt a sense of freedom with this project
        <br> and I put a lot of effort in. I also put in a bunch of extra features that weren't necessary and it gave me a sense
        <br> of pride; it made me feel that I had done a good job. I got a good mark so it was a happy ending and the
        <br> experience, despite how simple, has stuck with me since.
